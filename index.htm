		<p1 class="story">
			Ever since I was young, I have always been fascinated by the world of computers.
			During my childhood, like many others,  I played many video games, and was fascinated by how people made them.
			In grade 10, I decided to take a computer science course because of how interested I was in making games, and had not up to that point.
			This ignited something inside me and I've loved programming ever since.
			In grade 11 I took both a grade 11 and grade 12 computer science course so I could push my skills as far as i could.
			During my time in that class, I learned more than I could have thought, and loved every bit of it.
			Moving into my grade 12 year, I have obviously taken another computer science course and have decided to apply to computer science at carleton.
			With this, I found out about the Shopify Dev Degree opportunity, and I saw this as an amazing opportunity to make the most of my university learning experience, as I know how valuable work experience is.
